# War
This is a Python implementation of the card game, War.

I took an object-oriented approach to this game, building classes for a Card, a Deck, a Player, and a Game.

It is designed for two players.

## Rule Choices
- Shuffled winnings.
    I found that if I did not shuffle the winnings after every round, the game would sometimes take way too long
to finish.
